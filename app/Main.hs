        `playerState game` retrieves/extracts playerState from the GameState, `game`
        
        On the left side within the parenthesis, we have (Player current prev arrows)
          What this is doing is pattern-matching the structure of what is returned on the right side of the assignment

          This is a `name binding` which refers to the entire value of `playerState game`

        This should fix issue where when a player gets dropped in a new cave, 
        the previous position was still corresponded to their location
        prior to being flown away and placed in a random cave. 
        
        List comprehension explained: 
        It takes the dodecahedron and matches pos with the new final position
        it then extracts the list of neighbors via `back:_`
        and then it returns the `back` which was found

        UPDATE: It did fix the issue.
